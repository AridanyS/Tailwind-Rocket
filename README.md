# Tailwind-Rocket
[Tailwind-Rocket](https://sprightly-kataifi-24204e.netlify.app/) is a project to develop a website for a company called Acme Rocket ðŸš€

The main objective is to provide information about available space destinations, testimonials from other travelers, a contact section, and legal information.

The website was developed using a combination of technologies such as Tailwind CSS, HTML, and Javascript.

This project has been developed with the aim of practicing and applying the concepts learned during a Tailwind CSS course provided by Dave Gray's YouTube channel [Dave Gray](https://youtu.be/pYaamz6AyvU) 

Changes have been made to the original project in order to consolidate the acquired knowledge.
